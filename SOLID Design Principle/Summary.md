# Summary

1. Single Responsibility Principle
    - A class should only have one reason to change
    - Seperation of concerns - different class handling different, independent tasks/problems

2. Open-Closed Principle
    - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

3. Liskov Substitution Principle
    - You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

4. Interface Segregation Principle
    - Don't put too much into an interface; split into seperate interfaces
    - YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It

5. Dependency Inversion Principle
    - High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstraction
