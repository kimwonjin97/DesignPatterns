- Design Patterns are typically split into three categories

This is called **Gamma Categorization** after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors.

**Creational Patterns**
- Deal with the creation(construction) of objects.
- Explicit(constructor) vs. Implicit(DI, reflection, etc)
- Wholesale(single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)


**Structural Patterns**
- Concerned with the structure(ex. class members)
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface.
- Stress the importance of good API design

**Behavioral Pattern**
- They are all different; no central theme
