# Motivation
1. Objects use other objects' fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition
2. Composition lets us make compound objects
   1. E.g., a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or 
   2. A grouping of shapes that consists of several shapes
3. Composite design pattern is used to treat both single(scalar) and composite objects uniformly
   1. I.e, Foo and Collection<Foo> have common APIs.

Composite-> A mechanism for treating individual(scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.
